Description: The R package CSSN implements the two-step method proposed by Jinge Yu and Xiangyu Luo (2021+) that recovers spatially-varying cell-specific gene co-expression networks for single-cell spatial expression data. In this package, we employed a two-step algorithm to perform efficient thresholded Bayesian posterior estimates for gene co-expression networks in each cell and predict gene co-expression networks where cells are missing. CSSN can be installed in commonly used operating systems including Windows, Linux and Mac OS.
